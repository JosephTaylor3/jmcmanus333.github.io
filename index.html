  <p> Professional Interests:
    I am extremely passionate about Finance, Investing and Portfolio Management, and as I have pursued this passion I have attained: 
    Multiple FINRA and NFA professional licenses, a B.B.A. in Finance, an M.A. in Entrepreneurial Leadership in Global Business 
    (where my final paper focused on the due diligence process for Managed Funds that use AI or Machine-learning), 
    and a Certificate from the Institute of Trading and Portfolio Management for their Professional Trading Masterclass and their Professional Forex Trading Masterclass.

  <p> My hobbies are skiing, basketball, movies, binge-worthy tv, running and traveling. </p>
